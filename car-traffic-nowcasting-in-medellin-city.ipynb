    "# Car Traffic Nowcasting in Medellin City\n",
    "Each year Medellin drivers spend 138 hours stuck in traffic jams, which places the city as the 7° city in Latin America with the worst traffic, and number 25 among 220 cities in the world [1].<br>\n",
    "Many areas of transportation lack data, and decision-makers arround the world often plan infrastructure and policy based on uncertain information. In recent years, new types of sensors have become available, and ML can provide relevant information from these data, although the Medellin has this type of sensors, its analysis is currently carried out largely by humans, which significantly limits the amount of information available for decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to generate an open and high-quality API capable of estimating traffic at key points of the city, based on the information provided by traffic cameras, this in order to help and encourage the development of applications that cover the traffic problem in an intelligent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is part of the [ai colab](https://sites.google.com/view/aicolab/home) initiative"
